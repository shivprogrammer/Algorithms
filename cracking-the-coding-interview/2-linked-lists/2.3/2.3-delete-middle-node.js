2.3 Delete Middle Node

Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but the first and last node, not necessairly the exact middle), given only access to that node.

EXAMPLE

Input: the node c from the linked list a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f
Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a -> b -> d -> e -> f
