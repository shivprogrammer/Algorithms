/*
16.6 -- Smallest Difference

Given two arrays of integers, compute the pair of values (one value in each array) with the smallest (non-negative) difference. Retur7u8n the difference.

Brute force method // was what I came up with and correctly programmed

A more optimal approach is to sort the arrays. Once the arrays are sorted, we can find the minimum differene by iterating through the array.
