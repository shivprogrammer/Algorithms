# Ragnarok

Welcome to my algorithms playground! I'm glad you decided to check it out :)
Nearly every single algorithm that has been included in this file has been solved and tested, with the corresponding time and space complexities allocated for each solution (only exclusions are /codewars/close-but-bugs, /codewars/in-progress, & codewars/working-on).

1) Feel free to clone the repo
2) Once you've done so, in your terminal, type in: "npm i" to download the dependencies
3) Now you can go to any file you'd like, and type in "mocha " + (your_desired_file_name) to run the tests.

Feel free to explore!
