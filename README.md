Welcome to my algorithms playground! I'm glad you decided to check it out :)
Nearly every single algorithm that has been included in this file has been solved and tested (only exclusions are /codewars/close-but-bugs, /codewars/in-progress, & codewars/working-on).

Feel free to clone the repo
Once you've done so, in your terminal, type in: "npm i" to download the dependencies
Now you can go to any file you'd like, and type in "mocha " + (your_desired_file_name) to run the tests.

Feel free to explore!
