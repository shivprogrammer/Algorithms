/*
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers (1 <= n <= 100) and the square of their sum. For example, when n = 10:

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 55**2 = 3025

The sum of the squares of first ten natural numbers is :

1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385

Hence the difference between square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of those numbes is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

Example

differenceOfSquares(10) // => 2640
*/

function differenceOfSquares(x){
}
